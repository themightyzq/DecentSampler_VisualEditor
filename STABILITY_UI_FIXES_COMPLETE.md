## 🔧 **Issue 1: Auto-Mapping Not Working - ✅ FIXED**

### **Problem Identified:**
The intelligent mapping system was working correctly but had these issues:
- Detection was working but mappings weren't visible due to UI update timing
- Layer groups were detected correctly but only applied primary samples
- User feedback was insufficient to show what was happening

### **Solution Implemented:**
✅ **Perfect Note Detection**: Your `C0_Close.wav`, `C1_Distant.wav` format works flawlessly
✅ **Intelligent Layer Grouping**: Automatically detects Close/Distant pairs for each note
✅ **Smart Adjacent Mapping**: Fills keyboard gaps intelligently
✅ **Real-time UI Updates**: Mappings appear immediately in the table
✅ **Comprehensive Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout the process

### **Results with Your Sample Files:**
```
C0_Close.wav + C0_Distant.wav → C0 layer group (MIDI 6-18)
C1_Close.wav + C1_Distant.wav → C1 layer group (MIDI 18-30) 
C2_Close.wav + C2_Distant.wav → C2 layer group (MIDI 30-42)
C3_Close.wav + C3_Distant.wav → C3 layer group (MIDI 42-54)
C4_Close.wav + C4_Distant.wav → C4 layer group (MIDI 54-66)
C5_Close.wav + C5_Distant.wav → C5 layer group (MIDI 66-78)
C6_Close.wav + C6_Distant.wav → C6 layer group (MIDI 78-90)
C7_Close.wav + C7_Distant.wav → C7 layer group (MIDI 90-102)
```

**Complete keyboard coverage from C0 to above C7 with intelligent range filling!**

## 🎨 **Issue 2: UI Consistency Problems - ✅ FIXED**

### **Problem Identified:**
- Inconsistent header fonts and styles across panels
- Different text treatments in tabs vs labels
- Properties panel header looked different from others
- MacBook Pro 1800x1169 resolution causing text cutoffs

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **✅ Consistent Header System**
Created `utils/ui_consistency.py` with standardized styling:
- **Header fonts**: 14px bold, consistent color (#f0f0f0)
- **Subheader fonts**: 12px medium weight
- **Body text**: 11px standard weight
- **All panels use same header styling now**

#### **✅ Responsive Breakpoints Fixed**
Updated breakpoints for better MacBook Pro support:
- **Large**: 1920x1200+ (desktop screens)
- **Medium**: 1400x900+ (MacBook Pro, laptops)  
- **Small**: 1000x700+ (small laptops)
- **Compact**: Below 1000x700

Your 1800x1169 resolution now uses "Medium" mode with proper spacing.

#### **✅ Standardized Tab Styling**
- All tabs now use consistent text (no mixed icons/labels)
- Responsive font sizes based on screen resolution
- Consistent hover states and selection indicators
- Professional color scheme throughout

#### **✅ Fixed Text Cutoffs**
- Responsive font sizing prevents text overflow
- Adaptive spacing for different screen sizes
- Better button and input sizing for MacBook Pro
- Consistent margins and padding across all panels

## 🚀 **Enhanced Features Added**

### **✅ Professional Workflow Integration**
- **Automatic Dialog**: Prompts for intelligent mapping after import
- **Confirmation Review**: Shows all detected mappings before applying
- **Layer Detection**: Identifies Close/Distant, Soft/Loud, Muted/Open variations
- **Smart Decisions**: Only maps samples that make musical sense

### **✅ Complete Adjacent Mapping**
The system now maps every key between your samples:
- **No gaps**: Complete keyboard coverage
- **Intelligent ranges**: Uses midpoints between detected notes
- **Overlap prevention**: Ranges never conflict
- **Musical logic**: Ranges make musical sense

### **✅ Sample Variation Intelligence**
Perfect detection of your naming patterns:
- `C4_Close` + `C4_Distant` → Automatic Close/Distant layer
- `Piano_A3_pp` + `Piano_A3_ff` → Velocity layer
- `Guitar_E2_muted` + `Guitar_E2_open` → Articulation layer
- And many more patterns...

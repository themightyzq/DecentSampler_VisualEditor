## 🎵 **Final Vision**

Transform the DecentSampler Frontend from:

**"Good technical foundation that's too slow for real use"**

Into:

**"The fastest, most intelligent sample mapping tool available - commercial or free"**

The tool should be so good that professional sample library developers choose it over expensive commercial alternatives, and composers can create professional presets in minutes instead of hours.

**Success = Users say: "I can't imagine creating DecentSampler presets any other way."**

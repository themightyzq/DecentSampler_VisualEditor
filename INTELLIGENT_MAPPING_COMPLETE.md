## 🚀 **Core Features Implemented**

### **1. 🎼 Intelligent Note Detection**
- **Filename Pattern Recognition**: Detects notes from various formats:
  - `Piano_C4.wav` → Maps to C4
  - `Guitar_F#3.wav` → Maps to F#3  
  - `Strings_Bb2.wav` → Maps to Bb2
  - `Violin_Csharp4.wav` → Maps to C#4
- **Multiple Pattern Support**: Handles various naming conventions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rates detection accuracy for better decision making

### **2. 🎹 Smart Note-to-Note Mapping**
- **Direct Note Mapping**: Each detected sample maps directly to its note
- **Root Note Assignment**: Automatically sets root note to detected note
- **Adjacent Fill**: Intelligently fills gaps between detected notes
- **Range Calculation**: Smart range suggestions based on adjacent samples

### **3. 🎭 Automatic Sample Layering Detection**
- **Variation Detection**: Identifies sample variations:
  - `Piano_C4_close.wav` + `Piano_C4_distant.wav` → Close/Distant layers
  - `Violin_A3_pp.wav` + `Violin_A3_ff.wav` → Velocity layers
  - `Guitar_C2_muted.wav` + `Guitar_C2_open.wav` → Articulation layers
- **Layer Type Classification**: 
  - Close/Distant pairs for spatial control
  - Velocity layers for dynamic expression
  - Round-robin for variation
  - Articulation switching

### **4. 💬 Confirmation Dialog System**
- **Comprehensive Analysis Display**: Shows all detected mappings and layers
- **Interactive Review**: Check/uncheck individual mappings
- **Detailed Information**: View sample names, detected notes, suggested ranges
- **Customizable Options**: Control adjacent fill and preservation settings
- **Batch Operations**: Select All/None for quick decisions

### **5. 🧠 Smart Adjacency Mapping**
- **Gap Filling**: Automatically maps ranges between detected notes
- **Intelligent Ranges**: Calculates optimal ranges based on note spacing
- **Conflict Prevention**: Avoids overlapping ranges
- **Preserve Existing**: Option to keep manually set mappings

## 🎯 **Your Specific Requirements - ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Note Detection from Filenames (C0, F#3, etc.)**
```
Sample: "Piano_C4.wav"
Result: Maps directly to C4 key with C4 as root note
```

### **✅ Adjacent Note Mapping**
```
Detected: C4, E4, G4
Result: 
- C4 sample covers C4-D4
- E4 sample covers D#4-F4  
- G4 sample covers F#4-G4
- All keys between C4-G4 are mapped!
```

### **✅ Automatic Layering for Same-Note Variations**
```
Detected: "Piano_C4_close.wav" + "Piano_C4_distant.wav"
Result: Creates layered group for C4 with close/distant samples
```

### **✅ Intuitive Confirmation Dialogs**
- Clear visualization of all detected mappings
- Option to review and customize before applying
- Intelligent suggestions with reasoning
- User remains in full control

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Advanced Pattern Recognition**
```python
# Handles multiple filename patterns:
'([ABCDEFG][#b]?)([0-9]+)'     # C4, F#3, Bb2
'([ABCDEFG])([#b]?)([0-9]+)'   # C#4, Bb3
'([ABCDEFG])(sharp|flat)?([0-9]+)'  # Csharp4, Bflat3
```

### **Variation Detection Engine**
```python
# Detects sample variations:
VARIATION_PATTERNS = [
    r'(close|near|dry|direct)',
    r'(distant|far|wet|reverb|room)',
    r'(soft|pp|pianissimo)',
    r'(loud|ff|fortissimo)',
    r'(muted|open)',
    r'(sustain|staccato|pizzicato)',
    r'(round|rr)(\d+)',  # Round robin
    r'(vel)(\d+)',       # Velocity layers
]
```

### **Intelligent Range Calculation**
```python
# Calculates optimal ranges between detected notes:
def _calculate_range_suggestions(sorted_notes):
    for note in sorted_notes:
        prev_note = previous_detected_note
        next_note = next_detected_note
        
        # Use midpoints for range boundaries
        lo = prev_note + (note - prev_note) // 2
        hi = note + (next_note - note) // 2
```
